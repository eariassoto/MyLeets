/*
 * Assuming ASCII, problem assumes not case sensitivy, ignore non-letter chars
 *
 * By definition a palindrome is like a mirror, a character is going to be
 * mirrored, with the exception of the letter at the center. What we can do here
 * is to count all character appereances and check that at least one appereance is odd
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * taco cat
 *
 * tacocat
 *
 * o is at the center so its count is going to be 1
 * t, a, and c appeards 2 times each
 *
 * laol
 *
 * int this case, l has an even count, but a and o both have uneven counts, this
 * cannot be palindrom
 *
 * Since a permutation is just the same characters in a different order we can
 * use this premise as well
 *
 * Time complexity O(N)
 * Memory complexity O(N). A small optimization here is to use a unsigned int as lookupArr, given
 * that we only have 26 letters and, instead of counting we can toggle bit on and off.
